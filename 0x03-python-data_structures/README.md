# 0x03 Python Data Structures

This repository contains Python scripts and a C program created as part of the project "Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples" for the SE Foundations curriculum at ALX.

## Description

In this project, we explore various aspects of Python data structures, focusing on lists and tuples. The tasks covered include printing, accessing, replacing elements, working with sequences, and more.
